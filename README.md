### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 
This is Zhiyan Pei.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master's degree of Computer Science at Northeastern University.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in software development and am actively looking for 2023 summer/fall intern.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, a classic textbook. I think this book is really worth reading, since it helps me have a better understanding of fundamental principles of computer programming.
